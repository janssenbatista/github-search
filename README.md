### üìê App Architecture - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

Architectural pattern used in Android app development. It's a design pattern that separates an app's user interface (UI) into three main components, each with a specific role:

1. **Model:** The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for data manipulation, retrieval from data sources (such as databases or web services), and any other data-related operations. The Model doesn't have direct knowledge of the UI.
2. **View:** The View represents the UI elements of the application, which include everything the user interacts with, such as buttons, text fields, and images. In the MVVM pattern, the View is responsible for displaying data and capturing user input. Unlike the Model and ViewModel, the View does not contain application logic.
3. **ViewModel:** The ViewModel is an intermediary between the Model and the View. It is responsible for exposing data to the View and handling user interactions from the View. The ViewModel contains the presentation logic and prepares the data from the Model for display in the View. It also allows for decoupling the UI from the underlying data and business logic.
